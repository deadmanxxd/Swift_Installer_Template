	- com.android.settings --- the package name of the app
		- versions – here you can separate different app versions
			- v1 – will be any app version starting with 1
			- common --- treated like base common/ shared between versions

These can be in any folder
	-versions
	-props
	-common

they will act exactly like above

Any folder containing “versions”, “props”, or “common will be scanned and not treated like a resource path

Only put resources in common or a folder of their own
